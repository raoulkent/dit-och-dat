What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to get better at breaking down tasks into multiple tasks so that I easier can work in a more structured manner. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I worked together with a group member with one of the tasks over the past week. We have similar experience to programming in java so, collaborating on a task gave us a great possibility to learn from each other. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I completed my tasks for the last sprint, and I am happy the way it turned out. I communicated with team members when I needed help. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have come up with suggestions on the app layout and been part of the discussions. I’ve completed my tasks and suggested new ones for the next sprint.
