## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I would like to better my knowledge in sprint- reflection/review. This would make upcomming sprint in the future easier. Also it would help me get a better understanding of what thing demands more or less effort. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Upcomming sprints i would like to share my experience from previous sprints so the process of scrum would be easier to implement. Also when finished with my personla tasks i will help team members with additional tasks. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This sprint I helped my team by writing a lot on the final reflection. Diskussing how the implimentation of the scrum practice worked out for our team. I also diskussed how we will improve the implementation of scrum in future projects.  

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have been to all the meetings. I have contributed alot to the final reflection. Writing a majority of the this weeks content. I have also been keeping contact with the end user and communicating with his how much value he experienced from our application.
