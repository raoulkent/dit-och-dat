- What do I want to learn or understand better?
Find good colors, margins etc to improve the UX.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
For the upcoming sprint I plan to help everyone in the group as much as possible to finish their tasks
rather than having. Hopefully we can together achieve a more robust solution.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I participated the scrum meetings, had to skip one out of our 5 meetings this week due to
an important deadline in another course.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Had a very busy week so I had to work during the weekend, but I completed
every task that I was assigned except one (which is to create additional Unit-tests).
I also helped writing the team reflection like always.
