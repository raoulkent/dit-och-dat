- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Last week I had the practical part of a sailing education. When thu-sun was completely busy, there was not much room for me to finish my tasks. Further, the deadline for the Bachelor thesis hand-in is approaching and there's not much time. Though, I honestly did my very best last week. I put in 5h of coding but didn't manage to completely finish one of my tasks due to an error that I couldn't solve.
