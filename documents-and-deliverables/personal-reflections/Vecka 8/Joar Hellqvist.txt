- What do I want to learn or understand better?
I will look back on my past reflections to evaluate my progress, to learn more about how I personally can adapt to function as well as possible in a group. 

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I look forward to writing the final report. Hopefully I maybe can make someone learn something new regarding excel when analysing the progress of our KPI:s. 


- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I finished my tasks and participated in the meetings. I made a better estimation, of how comprehensive tasks I would be able to complete, than I've done past weeks. 

Unfortunately I didn't communicate in an acceptable manner during the last days of work regarding my bachelor thesis. This is something that I will truly be able to change this last sprint. 


- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I've compiled the KPI:evaluations to a simple spreadsheet so that we can track our progress regarding our different KPI estimates. I have worked on the team reflection.
