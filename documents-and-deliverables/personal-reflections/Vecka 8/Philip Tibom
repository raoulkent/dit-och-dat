- What do I want to learn or understand better?
How to polish the app and make it more user friendly.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
For the upcoming sprint I plan to help everyone in the group as much as possible to finish their tasks
rather than having. Hopefully we can together achieve a more robust solution.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Participated in scrum meetings everyday.

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I delivered the task that I was assigned but I didn't get time to help other team members this sprint.
Our largest deadlines are now over so we should be able to get back to our normal velocity in the
upcoming sprint.
