What do I want to learn or understand better?


This week we didn't have many things to do because it was re-examining week with easter hoodies .
 -How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By providing any information  or code help that I can provide to the team and by learning more about  android studio  and combining that with my knowledge, maybe I can provide some  benefit to the team .
 
-What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
 Nothing big this week we just decided that all the team members are going to work on a small project  to learn more about android main functionality .
 
 -What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?


I did my app as all the members did .
