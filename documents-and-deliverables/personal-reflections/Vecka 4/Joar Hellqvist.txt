What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn how to connect fragments and activities, how to make dynamic scrollable lists and methods for data storage.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since we have been working collaboratively in different constellations there has been rom for transfer of different knowledge between members. I look forward to continuing working in the same way. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
The past week has been characterized by great teamwork and positivity. I have been working on different tasks with different members of the group. The tasks I have been working on have been of increasing difficulty which has improved my understanding for Android Studio.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Taking responsibility for the tasks I have set out to do, along with the other group members that have done a lot of work, has made us able to achieve an MVP after a first sprint.
