## What do I want to learn or understand better?
We have devided to develop an android application. I am really looking forward to learning more about developing an android application. I am also looking forward to developing my skills in git. I am current pretty unexperienced with git and I think i can learn a lot from implementing it in our scrum project. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I will do my best to learn and develop my skills so I can share this knowledge with the rest of the group. Also I will contribute with all the knowledge i have gained in previous programing courses. Furthermore i will always be available in discord so my scrum team can always reach me if they need my help.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week I have been contributing through developing user-stories or job-stories. I use my knowledge and experience that i have in golf and tried to explain to the group what I would like to use in a golf app.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have writen the deliverables that was agreed upon. I helped develop the scope of the project.
