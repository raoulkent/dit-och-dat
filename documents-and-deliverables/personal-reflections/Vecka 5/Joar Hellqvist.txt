What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to improve when it comes to estimating my required efforts for different tasks during the sprint planning. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
My personal velocity was much lower last week than the week before. I spent too much time on my bachelor thesis, rather than putting the right number of hours into this project. The possibilities to learn someone else something new are minimized by that behaviour. To change this is what I bring with me to the following sprint. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I overestimated my capabilities when taking on the tasks for last week. A lot of the time I spent, went to trying different solutions in order to find an appropriate one. Alfred helped me with what kind of programmatic approach I could go for when solving the tasks. I worked on it but was not able to finish the tasks completely before the sprint was over. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Although I only put in around 8h on this course last week, which is something I’m not proud of, I have worked on my tasks and been writing on the team reflection along with the group. From now on, I will not hesitate to ask for help in order to further get going independently with my tasks so that I can finish them in time.
